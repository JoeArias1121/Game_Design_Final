# Fall 2024 - Intro to Game Design _@ SUNY New Paltz_
* Name: Joseph Arias
* [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/gxn5B77P/game-design-final)
* [Proposal]()

### 2024-10-01 - 2hr: I made my character with movement and added a tile map to the game
* I forgot how to make a character so I went back to the Brackey's video to make mine with movement and give it animation
* I added world boundaries on the left and right to contain the game and then gave it sprites
* I added some platforms to the world so that the player can jump onto
* TODO: I need to add movement to the platforms so that they can go down and then I need to add a killzone at the bottom

### 2024-09-30 - 2hr: I got my sprites and started building up the main scene
* I used https://craftpix.net/ to get my sprites
* I wanted to create a world boundary but I forgot how to do that so I referred to the Brackey's video
* TODO: I still need to add world boundaries on the left and right then add sprites to them
